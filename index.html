         <br>how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes
         <br>that your content sits inside. Then we looked at how to
        <br>place your boxes in the right place with respect to the viewport,

       <br> now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, 
       <br> modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some
        <br> of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
